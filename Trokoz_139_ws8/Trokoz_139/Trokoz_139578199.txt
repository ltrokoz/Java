Learning concepts in this workshop

In workshop 8, I learned how to create thread from another thread and this part was the most challengeable for me. Also, I learned about parallel and sequential methods and how to record execution time for the matrix addition task.
Furthermore, I honed my programming skills and got experience with solving Java tasks.


The instructions on how to run code:

1. Open IntelliJ 

2. Open project  

On the top left screen press "File" then chose "Open..." and chose the project folder, press "OK".

3. Run code â€“ Shift + F10 (Microsoft)

Press green sign on the top right screen side OR use shortkeys "Shift + F10" (for Microsoft)

4. Testing the program

Task 1 and Task 2:
For testing the program (task1 or task2) just press green sign on the top right screen side OR use shortkeys "Shift + F10" and the program displays solution.
