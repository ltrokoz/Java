Learning concepts in this workshop

This workshop 2 gave me opportunity to hone my programming skills with using arrays and basic coding techniques, creating classes and methods. Also, I learned how to utilize some built in functions and constructors.

I have a challenge with solving the logic part of income tax calculation as in the instruction the progressive income tax condition. It took a while once I got the testing result as in the instruction. Also, income tax is different for four groups of people. 
As soon I figured out the logic I was "fighting" with a coding it nice view. I wrote one tremendous code that gives correct output but is not readable. 

Overall, this workshop is interesting and useful for me.


The instructions on how to run code:

1. Open IntelliJ 

2. Open project  

On the top left screen press "File" then chose "Open..." and chose the project folder, press "OK".


3. Run code â€“ Shift + F10 (Microsoft)

Press green sign on the top right screen side OR use shortkeys "Shift + F10" (for Microsoft)


4. Testing the program

Once the program offers to choose the option (from 0 to 2) and user input is correct, the output will appear under the user's input.
