Learning concepts in this workshop

In workshop 11, I learned how to implement Cloneable and Comparable Interfaces. Therefore, I learned how to work with time in Java. 
Both tasks were challenging for me and it took days to figure out logic and realize the program idea.
Also, I honed my programming skills with basic Java techniques - creating arrays, classes, methods,  and processing user's input.


The instructions on how to run code:

1. Open IntelliJ 

2. Open project  

On the top left screen press "File" then chose "Open..." and chose the project folder, press "OK".

3. Run code â€“ Shift + F10 (Microsoft)

Press green sign on the top right screen side OR use shortkeys "Shift + F10" (for Microsoft)

4. Testing the program

Task 1 and Task 2:
Programs offer the user to input data. Once the user input data according to the instruction, the programs display the processing results.
